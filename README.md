## Global Economic Trends Analysis Project

### Project Overview

This project explores various economic indicators globally through the utilization of R, Tableau, and Datawrapper. The aim is to provide accessible, insightful visual interpretations of complex economic data, such as GDP distribution, government expenditure, and net exports. This comprehensive analysis helps in understanding the economic performance of countries and their comparative economic strengths and weaknesses.

### Key Visualizations

This repository includes several detailed visualizations that highlight different aspects of global economics:

1.  **GDP Distribution of Countries**
    
    -   This map displays the GDP distribution across the globe, with each country represented by circles color-coded and sized according to their GDP values. This helps illustrate the economic scale and disparities between different regions.

2.  **GDP % Based on Government Expenditure**
    
    -   A line chart that shows the percentage of GDP based on government expenditure from 1990 to 2020, highlighting how different countries manage their economic policies over time.
